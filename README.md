### About

When I use additive modpack first, I found REI does not included and other QOL mods too.  
So make new modpack!  
It's built off intergrav's project [Additive](https://modrinth.com/modpack/additive) for maximized performance, boosting your game's framerate up to 10 times.

> Want to know more information about the modpack? [Check out the Modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/modpack/additiveplus) for download links and more!

### Built With

This project was built with [packwiz](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz). To export, run `packwiz mr export` in one of the folders.
