When I use additive modpack first, I found REI does not included and other QOL mods too.\
So make new modpack!\
It's built off intergrav's project [Additive](https://modrinth.com/modpack/additive) for maximized performance, boosting your game's framerate up to 10 times.

## 🔄️ Sync quickly with additive

My goal is to keep project mostly same with additive modpack.

## 🐛 Reporting Issues

Experiencing bugs, crashes, or other issues? Feel free to open an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/misilelab/additiveplus/issues). Sometimes this may be an issue with Adrenaline, Additive and not Additiveplus itself, so I will move the issue accordingly if needed.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

For a few frequently asked questions, please visit the Adrenaline [wiki](https://github.com/intergrav/Adrenaline/wiki). It also has a few other helpful resources that I suggest you read, such as troubleshooting info and more :)
